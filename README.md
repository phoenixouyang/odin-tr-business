# Totally Real Business Landing Page

## Description

The Totally Real page is a **fake business page** created for my personal practice. It is inspired by by The Odin Project's Project: Landing Page. All content was made up by myself, and should not be mistaken for a real business - sorry, you cannot earn six figures by signing up as a TR rep.
